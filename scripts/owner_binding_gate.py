"""Every registered δC/Step owner, bound to the image that ships.

`assurance/token_refinement.toml` owns 48 rows over 45 source sites, and until
this row nothing asked whether any of them is in the firmware. A ledger of
functions is a claim about the SOURCE; the property is about the DEVICE, and the
step between the two — this function, that symbol, this ELF — was written
nowhere. Stage 11A work 4 is that step, and `BINARY-CHECKED` is the VALUE of a
`method` field here rather than a word in a sentence.

**The measurement that decides the design: 22 of the 45 owners have NO SYMBOL.**
Counted on the default image: 15 owners are standalone functions
`arm-none-eabi-nm` defines, 21 exist only as a DWARF abstract instance folded
into their callers (`seed.rs::clear_ppuat` at 4 call sites,
`state.rs::AssertionState::reset` at 5), and 8 are not in the image at all. A
gate written over the symbol table would call 21 correctly-owned,
correctly-shipped functions missing — which is worse than no gate, because the
fix for that noise is to delete the rule.

**A site is a QUALIFIED PATH, and that is a defect this gate shipped with.**
Keyed on `DW_AT_name`, `state.rs::reset` was ONE site merging the twelve DIEs of
four functions — `AssertionState`, `CredMgmtState`, `LargeBlobState` and
`FidoState` all declare `fn reset` in that file — and `bind` then took its
concrete instance from one and its symbol from another. Driven: deleting the two
production callers of the `authenticatorReset` session wipe
(`reset.rs::ctx.state.reset()`, `ctap.rs::scrub_secrets`) and rebuilding drops
`_ZN8rsk_fido5state9FidoState5reset17h…E` from the image, and the gate still said
`ok` — the owner reclassified `symbol`→`inlined` on the 15 call sites of its
three SIBLINGS. So identity is the demangled linkage name, and the count a file
must produce comes from the SOURCE (`declarations`): a function that vanishes
from the image would otherwise take its own requirement with it.

So the evidence for an inlined owner is a CALL SITE and not a debug-info entry.
`DW_TAG_subprogram` with `DW_AT_inline` says the compiler emitted a description
of the function; `DW_TAG_inlined_subroutine` pointing back at it through
`DW_AT_abstract_origin` says a caller kept the code. The first without the
second is documentation of a function that is not there, and this gate reads it
as `absent` — which is the whole difference between "absent because inlined" and
"absent because it did not make it in". Rust puts the name and the file on a
`DW_AT_declaration` DIE inside the type and hangs the instances off it by
`DW_AT_specification`, so both are resolved through that chain; 5711
specification references in this image, and reading the instances alone finds
`DW_AT_name` on none of them.

Two readers are imported rather than rewritten: `elf_gate` for which ELF, which
tools, and the `DW_AT_producer` parser — a STRIPPED image would otherwise read
as 45 absent owners and this gate would be decorative, so no producers is
refused before anything else is judged — and `ct_gate.demangle` for the legacy
`_ZN…` scheme 1332 of this image's symbols use, so a finding names a function
and not a mangling. The roster and its production/test split come from
`token_refinement_gate`, which derives both from the tree.

Scope is the DEFAULT image and the row's POSITION is what makes that true:
`check.sh` rebuilds `target/…/release/firmware` three more times below this row,
so the same row moved down to the other Python gates would audit the no-touch
binary. `assurance/image.toml` names the same path, and this gate holds its own
artifact against that field so the two cannot drift onto different binaries.
