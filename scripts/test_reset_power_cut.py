"""What `tests/29_reset_power_cut.py`'s cut instrument decides, driven on a fake board.

That script is board-only and the gate runs none of it, so its own guard — the
`PROCESSING` keepalive that separates a torn wipe from a cut which never reached
the device — could be deleted with `check.sh` fully green. It is the shape
`scripts/test_sram_residue_dump.py` already covers for `tests/54_sram_residue.py`,
and this file is that, one script over: the instrument is host-testable, because
everything below the USB handle is stubbed and the handle itself is a model of
hidapi's contract — a timed-out read returns an EMPTY list and raises nothing, a
write can be accepted by the host stack and never reach the device, and the
supply can go at an instant the open handle never notices.

Two tables, and the second is what makes the first worth reading. [`CHECKS`] is
one assertion per fact the record claims; [`MUTANTS`] breaks the instrument one
way per entry and NAMES the checks that must go red for it — so an arm that goes
red for the wrong reason is a failure here rather than a kill, which is the
distinction this programme has already been caught getting wrong. A mutant runs
only the scenarios its named checks need, which is why the table is affordable
as a gate row rather than as an overnight sweep.

What none of it can tell you is on the subject's own docstring: a keepalive is a
lower bound on `inside the handler`, never on `the first erase landed`. And what
it does not yet cover, found by review and left rather than padded: the post-cut
`getInfo` and `BACKUP_STATE` status asserts in `main`, `TappedHid.write`'s death
recorder, the foreign-keepalive console line, and the `len(frame) > 7` guard —
which goes red only as a mutant whose PATTERN stopped matching, so a weakening
that rewrote the arm with it would pass.
