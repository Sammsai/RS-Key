"""The mutation table `kani_gate.py` is verified against.

That guard was written after the daily row was found proving 29 of 49 harnesses,
and every round of it since has been checked by editing the real tree, running
it and reading the message — a battery living in a terminal scrollback, which is
exactly how the *previous* two gate scripts came to be the finding rather than
the instrument. `roster_gate.py` got a fixture for that reason; this is its
sibling, and it arrives with the tier split, when the guard stopped comparing
three strings and started reading a table.

Both directions are asserted. A guard that cannot go green is deleted as fast as
one that cannot go red, so the cases that must **not** fire are here too: a
`cargo kani setup` with no roster on it, and the per-crate `cargo kani -p rsk-x`
hints that live in source doc comments and say nothing about what CI proves.
