"""How the roster guards read a command out of a file they do not run.

`kani_gate.py` and `roster_gate.py` both ask whether a hand-written `-p` list is
still the whole truth, and both read the same files to do it. Each had to learn
the same things: a trailing `\\` folds two lines into one command, a `#` kills
the rest of a line wherever on that line it falls, a `cargo …` in a workflow is
only *run* when it sits inside a step's `run:` scalar — and, since both guards
now walk the checkout (one for proofs, one for stray package selections), which
directories are not the tree.

Those rules lived in two copies. 237fd00 judged the shared surface to be "a
five-line continuation-joiner", which was true then; ffbfaef then had to fix the
`#` rule in both scripts in one commit, and the coverage roster needs the `run:`
walk — block scalars, `- ` list items, indentation — as a third copy. Writing
that a third time is the defect both scripts exist to catch, one level up. What
a *package flag* is lives here for the same reason and later: the two had
drifted into different answers, one taking `--package` and the other not,
neither taking `--package=x`, so the same command read as two rosters.

The whole of "which packages is this command about" followed, and later still,
because a quarter of that answer each is what the three guards were reading —
`roster_gate` knew `--exclude`, `matrix_gate` knew only `-p`, and none of them
could see an operand an expansion fills in. [`selection`] is that answer; a
caller resolves a manifest path against its own checkout, which is the half
that cannot live here.

How to read *Rust* joined for the same reason and later still. `platform_gate.py`
grew a lexer so its unsafe inventory would not be written by a comment saying a
file has none; `shrink_gate.py` needs the same answer about `#[cfg(kani)]`, and a
second copy would have inherited the same gap (see [`rust_code`]).

Deliberately not here: what a roster *owes*. That differs per script and is the
reason there are two of them.
