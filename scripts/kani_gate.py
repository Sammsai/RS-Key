"""Assert the Kani rows, all of them, run every harness the tree has.

`cargo kani` is invoked with a hand-written `-p` list, and a crate that is not on
it is not proven — but nothing says so. The row was named "prove every harness"
and it was running 29 of 49. Never added: `rsk-ui` (the trusted display's
touch-target geometry — the anti-phishing consent surface), `rsk-led`
(`EF_LED_CONF`, a persisted record with a published wire format), `rsk-slip39`
and `rsk-bip39`. Green daily, asserting nothing about any of them. A harness in
an unlisted crate is worse than no harness, because the reviewer believes it
runs.

No per-crate count is written in that sentence any more, and the deletion is the
point: it used to say "`rsk-ui` (12 proofs" and the crate carried 14, in the same
words `assurance/crates.toml` and the `--write-readme` mirror of it in
formal/README.md were also carrying. A count belongs where something derives it,
so the ledger's is held to the tree by [`ledger_claims`] and this file states
none.

Third time a gate script has been the finding rather than the instrument (after
the test filter that matched nothing and the fuzz row blind to `[[bin]]`
targets), and the first two were fixed at the site with no guard, which is why
there was a third. So: the roster is checked, not remembered.

Since the proofs split into tiers — a fast one on every pull request, the
security-state crates when a change reaches them, all of them daily — the roster
is no longer a string to compare. `scripts/kani.sh` owns tier → crates and prints
the table with `--tiers`; this reads that table and asks four things of it:

* the `all` tier is exactly the crates carrying a `#[kani::proof]`, less
  [`EXCLUDED`] — both directions, so a crate with an unrun proof fails and so
  does a listed crate whose proof went away;
* every other tier is a non-empty subset of it, because a tier that selects
  nothing is a row that exits 0 having proved nothing (`kani.sh` floors the
  harness count for the same reason, one layer down);
* every tier is invoked by a row CI actually **runs** — inside a step's `run:`
  scalar, left of any `#`. Counting matching strings is not enough: a workflow
  header's local-equivalent comment is a second copy in the same file, so putting
  a `#` in front of the `run:` line once left three agreeing rosters and this
  guard green over a job that proved nothing. "Uncommented" is judged from the
  `#`, not from the line's first character — `run: true # scripts/kani.sh all`
  runs the `true`;
* and every tier is in docs/testing.md, which is what a reader copies and which
  says CI runs the same commands.

The counts those tiers are floored at are read the same way. `kani.sh`'s
`FLOOR_*`/`COVERS_*` say how many harnesses and `kani::cover!`s a run must come
back with, docs/testing.md prints the same numbers in a table, and all four sets
were kept by the instruction "raise it in the commit that adds one". They drifted:
`FLOOR_all` sat at 64 against a tree of 65, so one harness could have gone missing
under a floor that still passed. Counted from the source here instead, both
directions — a floor under the tree is loose, one over it demands more than a run
can report — and the same for the page's table. The count is comment-stripped,
because two `*_kani.rs` files discuss `kani::cover!` in prose, and a spelling
neither counter can see is refused by name rather than skipped: an uncounted
harness is a floor set one too low, which is the drift, and it would be silent.

Nothing outside `scripts/kani.sh` may write a `cargo kani` package selection into
a file that runs one. That is the rule the old three-way string comparison was
standing in for, and it is the one that stops a fifth copy from appearing the day
someone wants a fifth tier. It used to be a rule about three NAMED files, and the
list is what kept going wrong. `scripts/check.sh` arrived on it late, because it
was in NEITHER guard's reach: this one read the workflows and the page, and
`roster_gate.py` reads `check.sh` but hands the `kani` verb over by name —
correctly, since its rule is "selects the whole tree" and a Kani row selects the
proof-carrying subset on purpose. The hand-off went nowhere, and adding one file
to the list left the same hand-off open one file over: `nix/checks.nix` runs
`cargo`, `roster_gate` reads it and hands `kani` over, and a live
`cargo kani -p rsk-sha512 -p rsk-ec` there measured GREEN under both guards after
the fix. So is a roster in any other `scripts/*.sh`, one in a `.yaml` workflow
(the glob was `*.yml`), and one an expansion fills in (`-p "$c"` matches no crate
name). All four are closed by asking the CHECKOUT rather than a list — see
[`sources`] — and all four were found latent, which is the state every guard hole
in this tree has been found in. A `cargo kani -p <crate>` in a source file's doc
comment or an evidence bundle is still not in scope: it tells a reader how one
run was made, it does not claim to say what CI proves.

Deliberately syntactic. It cannot say a harness proves anything worth proving —
that is the harness's own business — only that the solver is pointed at it.
