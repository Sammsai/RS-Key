"""Hold the level 11C decision record's measurements to the tree.

`docs/verified-compilation.md` declines verified compilation for the RP2350, and
every reason it gives is a number about this tree: how much of the one
already-foreign kernel is assembly, how many of the FIDO gate functions are
generic over a trait, how many `[[boundary]]` rows a second FFI boundary would
join, how much of `scripts/check.sh` is Rust-shaped. A decision record whose
numbers nothing re-derives is a decision that was true the day it was typed —
which is the defect `scripts/docs_constants.py` is named after, one register out:
that row holds a doc's copy of a Rust `const`, and none of these is a `const`.

Deliberately the same shape as that row and NOT a generated region. A region
would make the page's argument unreadable in the diff — the numbers are inside
sentences that reason with them — and the reader of a decision record is a person
following an argument, not a table. So each rule is a pattern with a hole: the
tree says what the number is, the page has to say the same, and a sentence that
was REWORDED AWAY is a finding too, because a pattern that stops matching reports
the same way a wrong value does. That is the half `docs_constants.py` leaves
open — deleting a stated constant there is exit 0 — and it is the half that
matters here, since the cheapest way to make a stale decision record green is to
stop saying the thing that went stale.

Nothing here is hand-written except the sentence shapes. Every value is derived
on the run, so the page cannot be repaired by editing this file.
