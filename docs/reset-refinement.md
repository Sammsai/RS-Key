# Cross-reset refinement pilot

This is the phase-6 bridge for `SEC-FIDO-006`,
`ResetNeverWeakensSurvivingState`. It joins the existing TLA+ reset machine to
the concrete FIDO reset order, the `rsk-fs` power-cut contract, and a real-board
test. **RS-Key is not formally verified**, and this page does not move that:
the C→B step is bounded,
the flash composition has an executable oracle rather than a deductive proof of
the storage backend, and a HIL result witnesses only the cut that was run.

## The property

The registry requirement is relational: no prefix of `authenticatorReset`,
whether it returns, aborts, or loses power, may keep an owner's usable secret
after removing the gate that protected it. The three independently named
clauses are:

| ID | Clause | Surviving fact | Gate that must still exist |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SEC-FIDO-006A` | `ResetKeepsThePinGate` | owner credential + owner seed | `EF_PIN` |
| `SEC-FIDO-006B` | `ResetKeepsTheAlwaysUvGate` | owner credential + owner seed | `EF_ALWAYS_UV` |
| `SEC-FIDO-006C` | `ResetKeepsTheBackupSeal` | owner's pre-reset seed | `EF_BACKUP_SEALED` |

The last gate reads backwards: deleting the seal is permissive because it
re-opens the one-time seed-export window. A newly provisioned seed after reboot
is therefore not the owner's surviving seed and does not violate the clause.

## Evidence ladder

| Layer | Owner | What it establishes |
|---|---|---|
| Requirement | `assurance/properties.toml` | Stable IDs, statements, and the bounded evidence ceiling |
| TLA+ B | `formal/RSKeySecurityState.tla` | Arbitrary ordering within the secret and gate phases; abort, real power cut, boot-time seed provisioning, and all three clauses |
| Rust refinement | `crates/rsk-fido/src/reset_assurance.rs` | The concrete phase machine and abstraction of the persistent/volatile facts observed by the clauses |
| Kani | `crates/rsk-fido/src/reset_refinement_kani.rs` | Initialization and one-step induction across begin, every relevant delete, phase advances, abort, finish, reboot, and an unrelated FID |
| Power-cut fuzz | `fuzz/fuzz_targets/power_cut.rs` | The real `rsk_fido::reset::reset` over `SeqStorage`, with byte-granular cuts inside writes/erases, fresh caches, `Fs::scan`, `ensure_seed`, and a second boot |
| Real board | `tests/29_reset_power_cut.py` | The same owner seed/PIN/alwaysUv/resident-credential scenario with physical USB power removed while RESET is in flight |

The generated table in `formal/README.md` derives the Kani, fuzz, and runtime
columns by property name. A runtime column of one means that the HIL harness is
owned and discoverable; it is not a stored claim that a particular board run
passed.

## Concrete projection C→B

`ResetPersistentView` observes both seed records, one representative resident
credential, the PIN and alwaysUv gates, and the backup seal. The credential is
usable only while the **owner's** old seed is reachable. `ResetVolatileView`
observes only the RAM seed copy and live token; all other `FidoState` buffers are
irrelevant to this property.

The transition projection uses production's own `reset_phase(fid)` classifier.
That classifier delegates to the shipped `is_fido_seed_fid`, `is_fido_fid`, and
`is_fido_gate_fid` predicates, so the proof cannot silently acquire a second
hand-written gate list. Its phases match the implementation:

1. retire volatile state;
2. delete `FIDO_SEED_FIDS`;
3. sweep non-gate FIDO secrets until enumeration completes;
4. sweep gates until enumeration completes;
5. provision the next identity epoch.

Step 2 is a fixed two-fid `for` with nothing to enumerate, so it cannot stop the
wipe; step 3's predicate is `is_fido_fid && !is_fido_gate_fid`, which covers the
seed fids, so a seed the medium refused to remove is re-yielded **there** and
stops the wipe before step 4 (0x098B). The projection follows that: the 2→3
boundary is unguarded and the seed holds the 3→4 boundary shut. Closing 2→3
instead — which is how the projection read until this was measured — makes "in
the secret sweep with a live seed" unreachable, and every obligation about step 4
over a live seed is then discharged vacuously: merging steps 3 and 4 into one
sweep, the audit run-36 defect itself, left all four harnesses green.

`well_formed` is the induction domain. It requires retired volatile state once a
reset is active, the phase order above, and all three relational clauses. Kani
proves that construction starts inside this domain and that every modeled
concrete step preserves it. Each harness has a satisfiable `kani::cover!`; the
ordinary unit tests also inject one early-gate mutant per clause and require its
exact property to fail.

This is a finite Boolean projection and a one-step induction proof, not an
unbounded proof of the `sweep` loop. Loop termination and truncated enumeration
remain production tests; byte-level atomicity is composed below.

## The `rsk-fs` composition and reboot seam

The projection treats one completed `force_delete` as a record transition. The
lower contract is the existing `rsk-fs::powercut` oracle and its Kani rules:
`delete_landed` allows the old record or a fully deleted record, never a value
gone behind surviving metadata. The `power_cut` target now feeds a separate
input class through the complete real FIDO reset on the same cuttable flash
stack rather than adding another fuzz target.

After a cut the target drops the dead store, rebuilds `SeqStorage` with fresh
caches over the surviving bytes, scans it, runs boot-time `ensure_seed`, and
checks the three clauses. It then boots and scans once more so a verdict cannot
depend on the recovery mount's cache. A local corpus run on 2026-08-16 completed
4,608 executions without a finding; that is sampled evidence, not an exhaustive
result.

## Real-power HIL

The test is deliberately destructive and is not run by the emulator:

```sh
nix develop -c python tests/29_reset_power_cut.py
```

Use a throwaway board running the no-touch test image. The script exports and
seals the owner seed, sets a PIN, enables alwaysUv, creates a resident
credential, starts RESET, and asks for a real cable pull. A relay can be supplied
through `RSK_POWER_CUT_CMD`; `RSK_POWER_CUT_DELAY_MS` moves the cut point. A
RESET that finishes before power disappears is `INCONCLUSIVE`, not PASS.

**A cut has to be shown to have landed in the wipe.** The assertions after the
reboot are all about a fail-closed device, and a board on which the reset never
began is fail-closed for free — so a cut that arrives before the request does
satisfies every one of them. The device settles it: `rsk_usb::ctaphid` enters
`run_with_keepalive` only once the whole CBOR request is reassembled and writes
its first `CTAPHID_KEEPALIVE` one `KEEPALIVE_MS` later, so a frame carrying
`STATUS_PROCESSING` means the request arrived and the handler had been running
that long. `STATUS_UPNEEDED` means the opposite — a touch ceremony that stands
ahead of every flash write. Without a `PROCESSING` frame the run is
`INCONCLUSIVE`. It does not prove an erase landed; nothing on this wire does.

A frame counts only on **our** channel id. Every open handle on a HID device
sees every input report, so another host process's slow CBOR command streams
its own `PROCESSING` keepalives into this queue while our request is still
unread in the OUT buffer — and unscoped, those frames say the wipe began when
what began was somebody else's command. The three `INCONCLUSIVE` worlds are
told apart in the message: a board that ANSWERED (a RESET refused past the
CTAP 2.1 §6.6 window comes back `0x30` well under the floor, and no later cut
changes that), a board still waiting for a finger, and a cut that arrived
before the request — only the last of which is cured by cutting later.

That puts the cut in a band rather than at an instant: above 100 ms, where the
first keepalive is, and below the 487.2 ms the whole reset took on the board
`assurance/board/PLAT-FLASH-001.toml` cites. **The operator still cuts on the
printed `CUT POWER NOW` line, not on the Enter**: the line is printed at
most 0.11 ms after the window opens — the widest value over every run measured,
not a selection of them — so a 200–300 ms reaction to it lands in the band, where a
yank riding the Enter lands at ~0 ms — under the floor, and indistinguishable
from a cut that never reached the board. The relay's default delay is
`2 * KEEPALIVE_MS` for the same reason.

**What the band costs the row.** `reset()` starts at 0 and the confirmable band
opens at 100 ms, so the first `KEEPALIVE_MS` of the handler — where
`request_rescrub` and the first tombstones land — is un-PASSable by
construction: a cut there is `INCONCLUSIVE` whether or not it tore anything.
Driven against a simulated board on a 1 ms grid the verdict flips at the
floor exactly — the last `unconfirmed` is 100 ms, the first `torn` is 101 —
and a real board adds USB and host latency that nothing here measures, so the
false-red band starts at 100 ms and ends somewhere above it that this cannot
name. The 200 ms default is 100 ms clear of the floor. The direction is the
safe one — the instrument refuses a run it cannot confirm rather than passing
it — but it means PLAT-FLASH-001's sweep can never report on the earliest part
of the window it is asked to sweep. Closing that needs a signal earlier than
the first keepalive, and this wire has none.

Either way the cut is appended to a JSON-lines record, one object per cut, since
one run is one cut and a sweep is a series of runs. It defaults outside the
checkout and `RSK_POWER_CUT_LOG` moves it. Nothing in it is called "the delay":
the sender's transfer death and the host-observed disappearance are upper bounds
on the cut, the last frame that came back is a lower bound, the first
`PROCESSING` keepalive says when the device was known to be inside the reset,
and each is written under the bound it is with the error floor it carries. A
transfer that died of `ctaphid`'s own read budget rather than of the handle
failing bounds nothing, and says so instead of pretending to.

The line is the CUT's verdict and says so in its own `records` field, because
it is written before `main`'s post-reboot assertions run: a run that FAILED
them leaves the same `torn` line a passing one leaves. What joins the two is
`run_id`, printed beside `PASS` as well — read the exit code off that
transcript, never off the record. `run_id` is also what separates our lines
from anyone else's in a shared file: the append refuses a symlink and nothing
else, because the normal case for this path is one that already exists.

Flashing and operating the hardware remain maintainer actions. Consequently a
fresh real-board PASS must be recorded separately before calling the roadmap's
hardware witness complete.

## Verus / Creusot decision

No third verifier is added for this pilot. The decision is measured rather than
based on modeling convenience:

- a direct Kani run through the full `FidoState::reset()` was stopped after
  72.45 s without a verdict while CBMC expanded `zeroize` loops through at
  least 398 iterations; the unrelated crypto buffers dominated the formula;
- after projecting the two volatile facts the property actually observes, the
  parent harness solved in 0.52 s and the three clause harnesses in 0.45–0.48 s
  on Kani 0.67.0; all four covers were reachable;
- the byte-level and full-state links are exercised by the real reset unit tests
  and power-cut fuzz, where the complete storage and `FidoState` are affordable.

This is a tractable bounded-proof boundary, not evidence that an unbounded loop
or state-size limit prevents the required argument. Verus or Creusot would add a
third toolchain without removing the abstraction obligation, so the decision is
**not now**. Revisit it only if a later requirement needs an unbounded sweep or
multi-step state space that cannot be reduced without dropping a security-
visible fact.
